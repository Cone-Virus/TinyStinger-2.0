# TinyStinger V2.0
- Version 2.0?
There is an earlier rendition of the tinystinger so I decided to make it python based, a sqlite3 DB, and a shell instead of a clunky GUI

- What is it?

A small Bug Bounty scanner that I have been working on to not only make doing bug bounties easier but to help other small bug bounty enthuasiasts.
- Keep in mind

I am not an expert coder so there will probably be a ton of bugs and if something bad happens to your system I am not liable. But nothing should just a quick disclaimer.

## Setup 
- Before first use do the following:
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
You do need to have GO installed
## TODO
- [ ] Make a better readme
- [ ] Add Subdomain Enumeration
